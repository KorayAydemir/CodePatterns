To run, simply:
```console
$ make
```

You need to have make installed on your computer to run the project.
Or you can look at the Makefile and run the compile/run commands yourself
Easiest way to install make on windows is to use scoop. Set it up following the guide here https://scoop.sh/
and then type 
```console
$ scoop install make
```
